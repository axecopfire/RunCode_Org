    "info": "An Army dude, doing defensive stuff for a Cyber Protection Team. I have been doing Python work for about 4 years, prior to that, PHP on and off since around '04.  Generally speaking, for the team, I don't end up doing much analyst work anymore, mostly building tools and workflows for the analysts to be more efficient. For Run Code, I work on the site, engine, and everything. I wrote the frontend, wrapped it in some nasty bootstrap. I also wrote the backend, implementing a Docker setup devised by Mr. Scott Hamilton."

    "info": "A Software Engineer at St Jude Children's Research Hospital where he provides support migrating cutting edge cancer research out of the laboratory and into clinical usage.  He also serves as a Cyber Operations Technician in the US Army Reserves.  He has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, B.S in Computer Engineering, and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering.  How that landed him in healthcare and cyber security is still a mystery. \n Outside of work you'll find him still behind a computer playing games, breaking his homelab, or working on RunCode.  Matthew is the newest member of the team, so if anything is broken it is safe to assume he is to blame."
